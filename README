Win32::Setupsup version 1.02, released November 5, 2011


This module helps you to control other Windows programs.  It's
especially useful for programs that don't provide their own scripting
language or OLE Automation support.

The Win32::CtrlGUI module provides a more user-friendly wrapper around
Win32::Setupsup.  You should probably use it instead of trying to use
Win32::Setupsup directly.



INSTALLATION

The C++ part of Win32::Setupsup uses Microsoft's Structured Exception Handling,
which is not supported by MinGW's gcc.  Therefore, it does not work with
Strawberry Perl.  You need to compile Perl (and Win32::Setupsup) with
Microsoft's Visual C++.  Porting help is welcome.

To install this module type the following:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install
